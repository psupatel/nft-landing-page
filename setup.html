        <h1>Setting up your NFT Wallet</h1>
        &nbsp
        &nbsp
        <h5>Want to receive and store NFTs?  This tutorial will cover the absolute minimum you need to know to set up a cryptocurrency wallet where you can store your NFTs.  There are many videos and articles providing more information if you're interested. We recommend starting with Coinbase Wallet.  It is a simple browser plug-in, so it's easy to get started fast.  Plus Coinbase has great step-by-step instructions and support in case you have any issues.</h5>
        
        <h2>Step 1</h2>
        &nbsp
        
        <h5>Visit this <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/wallet/browser-extension/coinbase-wallet-extension">link</a>and follow the instructions for downloading and installing Coinbase Wallet.  Note: You will need to  use the Chrome browser.</h5>
        &nbsp
        
        <h2>Step 2</h2>
        &nbsp
        
        <h5>Once you have a wallet set up, you will see a screen that looks similar to the one below.  Click on the down arrow button to view your wallet address.  Note that you have different addresses for Ethereum and Solana. Your wallet address is like your email address - you can share it with people so they can send you crypto or NFTs. Also note the NFT tab in the middle of the window.  This allows you to view your NFT collection.  Initially this will be empty. </h5>
