        <h1>Setting up Coinbase Wallet</h1>
        &nbsp
        &nbsp
        <h4>Want to receive and store NFTs?  These steps will cover the absolute minimum you need to know to set up a cryptocurrency wallet where you can store your NFTs. </h4>
        &nbsp
        <h4>We recommend starting with Coinbase Wallet.  It is a simple browser plug-in, so it's easy to get started fast.  Plus Coinbase has excellent educational resources and support in case you need it.</h4>
        &nbsp
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        &nbsp
        
        <h4>Visit this <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/wallet/browser-extension/coinbase-wallet-extension">link</a> and follow the instructions for downloading and installing Coinbase Wallet.  You will need to  use the Chrome browser.</h4>

        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        &nbsp
        
        <h4>Once you have a wallet set up, you will see a screen that looks similar to the one below.  Familiarize yourself with what it shows you.  Click on the down arrow button to see your wallet address for the Ethereum and Solana blockchains. Your wallet address is like your email address - you can share it with people so they can send you cryptocurrency and NFTs.  Also note the NFT tab in the middle of the window.  This will allows you to view your NFT collection once you start to build it. </h4>
