        <h1>How to Set Up Coinbase Wallet</h1>
        &nbsp
        &nbsp
        <h4>Want to receive and store NFTs?  These steps will cover the absolute minimum you need to know to set up a cryptocurrency wallet where you can store your NFTs. </h4>
        &nbsp
        <h4>We recommend starting with Coinbase Wallet.  It is a simple browser plug-in, so it's easy to get started fast.  Plus Coinbase has excellent educational resources and support in case you need it.</h4>
        &nbsp
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        &nbsp
        
        <h4>Visit this <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/wallet/browser-extension/coinbase-wallet-extension">link</a> and follow the instructions for downloading and installing Coinbase Wallet.  You will need to  use the Chrome browser.</h4>

        &nbsp
        &nbsp
             
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        &nbsp
        
        <h4>Once you have a wallet set up, you will see a screen that looks similar to the one below.  Click around to familiarize yourself with it.  The down arrow button shows you your wallet address, which you can share with people similar to how you would share your email address.  You will also see that your balance is $0 and you initially have no NFTs.</h4>

        &nbsp
        <h3>Important considerations:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> Think about it - you never provided your name or email address! Nobody knows who you are when you exchange crypto assets, including Coinbase.  So if you lose/forget your password or secret recovery phrase, nobody can access your account.  It is gone forever.  Keep these in a safe place! </li>
          <li> You will usually not know the exact identity of the person you are exchanging crypto assets with.  For this reason, it is good to be very careful when making transactions.  If you see something you don't expect or you're not sure, don't make the transaction!  Once your assets are gone, transactions can not be reversed. </li>
          <li> Your private key is stored in your Coinbase Wallet and effectively represents 'ownership' of your wallet.  Coinbase intentionally makes it hard to find this key because if you accidentally share it, you are giving someone else full control of your assets. Do not share your private key with anyone! </li>
